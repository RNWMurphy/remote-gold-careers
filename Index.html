# Remote Gold Careers

🚀 **Remote Gold Careers** is a verified remote job board I created to help professionals find **legitimate work-from-home opportunities** without the frustration of scams, MLMs, or fake postings.  

This repository serves as a **portfolio showcase** for recruiters, employers, and collaborators, and includes a static landing page hosted on GitHub Pages.
